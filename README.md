# MQTT Smarthome

My personal "smart" home logic is (partially) realized with this MQTT helper.
This is mainly public just to be more open source and maybe to inspire others with their needs.
Also I can reuse it easier this way.

This is running for me nearly unchanged for over a year now and just works.
Rust stable is targeted on a Raspberry Pi 1B (The 1 core 512 MB one).
I do not intend to write documentation or how to use it other than what I personally need.
If you (try to) use it or find bugs, feel free to contact me about it.

Hint: Not to be confused with [mqtt-smarthome](https://github.com/mqtt-smarthome/mqtt-smarthome).
This is a helper to work with MQTT messages, the other is a way to structure MQTT messages.
